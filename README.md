**GitHub Repository Description: Football Live Score Web Scraping Project**

**Project Overview:**
This GitHub repository contains a web scraping project designed to fetch live football scores from the website https://www.fotmob.com/. The script takes user input to determine whether to fetch data for "Today" or a "Specific day." If the user chooses the latter, they need to provide a date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD."

**Features:**
1. User Input Handling: The script prompts the user to specify whether they want data for "Today" or a "Specific day" (with input validation to ensure correct format).
2. Background Web Scraping: To handle the website's dynamic rendering, the project utilizes the Selenium library to launch a headless Chrome browser, which fetches the HTML content of the specified page without displaying the GUI.
3. Data Scraping: The BeautifulSoup library is employed to parse the HTML and extract relevant match details, such as team names, scores, start time, and live status.
4. Error Handling: The script gracefully handles scenarios where the required fields are not found on the page (e.g., match scores or live status).
5. CSV Output: The extracted match details are stored in a CSV file named "match_details.csv" for easy data management.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries (Selenium, BeautifulSoup, pandas) installed.
3. Install ChromeDriver using WebDriver Manager to ensure compatibility.
4. Run the script, and it will prompt you for data selection and a date if necessary.
5. The script will then scrape the football live scores and store them in a CSV file named "match_details.csv" in the same directory.
